# Nosql_Challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

#Overview
I created, and imported the data into the database. Followed by connecting to the MongoDB a Jupyter Notebook and PyMongo:

Using the establishments.json data file provided and imported it into my dataset using MongoImport
In a jupyter notebook, I imported the required libraries:
1. PyMongo
2. Pretty Print (pprint)
3. Create an instance of the Mongo Client

After doing the setup, I conducted an analysis based of the UK Food Standards datasets
   
#Note
I could not upload the establishment.json file as it is too big so I wanted to share a google link with the file instead:
